**Revisions Made Post-Lecturer Comments**
The lecturer emphasized that comparing frames before and after applying a filter is not meaningful because filters inherently change the image. The evaluation should instead compare the filters with reference images from other applications or rely on subjective analysis for beauty and accessory filters. But the filters implemented in this project are custom-designed and differ significantly from filters available in standard applications like Instagram or Snapchat. As a result, metrics like PSNR and SSIM, which rely on comparing images with similar effects or a reference image, are not applicable.  The focus on FPS and visual inspection ensures that the project's results are practical, understandable, and aligned with its aesthetic goals.1. Evaluation Metrics:   - Removed comparisons using PSNR and SSIM due to the lack of meaningful reference filters.   - Focused evaluation exclusively on FPS (quantitative) and visual inspection (qualitative).   - Focus on practical user experience: Filters like "Smooth Skin" or "Blush" aim to enhance aesthetics and provide a visually pleasing experience. These goals are best assessed through qualitative visual inspection rather than quantitative metrics that might not align with user perception.2. Results Table:   - Updated the table in the report to include FPS values only.   - Reorganized observations to highlight FPS performance for real-time usability.3. Evaluation:   - Modified evaluation slides to focus on FPS and qualitative feedback.   - Added a slide detailing the experimental setup, including system specifications.4. Conclusion:   - Adjusted to emphasize the project's strengths in real-time processing and aesthetic quality.   - Addressed limitations in tracking accuracy for accessory filters.   - Suggested future work, such as improving facial tracking and extending datasets.5. Challenges:   - Added notes on alignment issues and the absence of standardized reference filters for evaluation.
